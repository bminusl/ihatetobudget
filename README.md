## About

Managing your budget and knowing where your money goes is important. I had tried various budgeting methods for many months, but never stuck with one. So I designed IHateToBudget, a simple and efficient application that meets my needs.

And it is also available for you.

## Features

#### Overview

The *overview* page lets you see the overall statistics.

![Overview](./screenshots/overview.png)

#### Sheet

Each month is represented by a sheet. Individual expenses are grouped into categories.

#### Categories

The *categories* page lets you define the name and color of each category.

#### History

The *history* page lets you explore and filter all expenses.

### Roadmap

Here is a list of the features that should be added in the future:

* Support HTTPS ðŸ”’
* Set goals (per category/month) ðŸ¥…

Also, see the [open issues](https://github.com/bminusl/ihatetobudget/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Installation & Configuration

### Docker method

**The following instructions are guidelines. You're free to adapt these to your needs.**

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), if you haven't already.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bminusl/ihatetobudget.git
   cd ihatetobudget
   ```

3. Create a copy of:

   * `docker-compose.yml.example` as `docker-compose.yml`
   * `docker-compose.env.example` as `docker-compose.env`
   * `Caddyfile.example` as `Caddyfile`

   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.yml.example docker-compose.yml
   cp docker-compose.env.example docker-compose.env
   cp Caddyfile.example Caddyfile
   ```

   Note: Making copies ensures that you can `git pull` (or equivalent) to receive updates without risking merge conflicts with upstream changes.

4. Edit `docker-compose.env` and adapt the following environment variables:

   * `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: This is the secret key used by Django.

5. Run `docker-compose up -d`. This will build the main image, and create and start the necessary containers.

6. To be able to login, you will need a super user. To create it, execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm ihatetobudget pipenv run python manage.py migrate
   docker-compose run --rm ihatetobudget pipenv run python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   This will prompt you to set a username, an optional e-mail address and finally a password.

7. You should now be able to visit your [IHateToBudget instance](http://127.0.0.1:80) at `http://127.0.0.1:80`. You can login with the username and password you just created.

## Updating

### Docker method

**The following instructions are guidelines. You're free to adapt these to your needs.**

1. Navigate to the root of the repository.

2. Run `docker-compose down`. This will stop all containers.

3. **Create a backup of the database**â€”just in caseâ€”, e.g. run `cp db.sqlite3 db.sqlite3.bak`.

4. Upgrade the codebase to the desired revision, e.g. run `git pull`.

5. Migrate the database:

   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm ihatetobudget pipenv run python manage.py migrate
   ```

   This action will synchronize the database state with the current set of models and migrations.

6. Run `docker-compose up --build -d`. This will rebuild the main image, and create and start the necessary containers.

## Usage and Contributing

Feel free to use IHateToBudget however you want (as long as it respects the [License](#license)). I maintain this project primarily for my own use. If you can think of any relevant changes that should be incorporated into the code, you can contribute by submitting an issue, or even a pull request. I don't plan on adding any developer documentation, though.
